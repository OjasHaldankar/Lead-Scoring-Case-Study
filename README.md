#Lead Scoring Case Analysis

Industry professionals can purchase online courses from X Education, an education firm. Many experts who are interested in the courses visit their website and look through the offerings on any given day.<br>

The business advertises its classes via a number of websites and search engines, including Google. Upon accessing the website, these individuals may peruse the available courses, complete the course registration form, or view some videos. These folks are categorized as leads when they complete a form with their phone number or email address. Additionally, the business receives leads from previous recommendations. After obtaining these leads, sales team members begin calling, emailing, and so on. Some of the leads convert during this process, but the majority do not. At X education, the lead conversion rate is typically 30%.<br>

X Education currently has a very low lead conversion rate despite receiving a lot of leads. For instance, only roughly thirty of the 100 leads they obtain each day are converted. The organization wants to find the most potential leads, or "Hot Leads," in order to streamline this procedure. The lead conversion rate should increase if they are able to locate this group of leads because the sales staff will now be spending more time corresponding with the prospects rather than calling everyone.<br>

You have been assigned by X Education to assist them in identifying the most promising prospectsâ€”that is, the leads with the highest likelihood of becoming paying clients. According to the company's requirements, you must create a model in which you give each lead a score, meaning that clients with higher lead scores are more likely to convert than those with lower scores. The intended lead conversion rate, as stated by the CEO in particular, is approximately 80%.<br>

Info: A historical leads dataset containing about 9000 data points has been sent to you. This dataset includes a number of factors that may or may not be helpful in determining whether or not a lead will be converted, including Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc. In this instance, the target variable is the column "Converted," which indicates whether or not a previous lead was converted (1 indicates it was, and 0 indicates it wasn't). The data dictionary included in the zip folder at the bottom of the page has extra information about the dataset. The levels seen in the category variables are something else you should look out for. Consider this: 'Select' is a level that many categorical variables have. It must be handled because it is equivalent to a null value.

Goals of the Case Study There are quite a few goals for this case study.<br>

Create a logistic regression model that will allow the business to target potential leads by giving each lead a score between 0 and 100. In contrast, a lower number would indicate that the lead is chilly and unlikely to convert, but a higher score would indicate that the lead is hot and likely to convert. You will also need to deal with some additional issues that the company has highlighted, which your model should be able to adapt to in the event that the company's requirements change in the future. A separate doc file contains these problems. Kindly complete it using the logistic regression model that you obtained in the initial stage. Don't forget to include this in the section of your final PowerPoint where you'll offer suggestions.<br>
